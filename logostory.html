<h2 style="text-align: center"><small> Why have a bee as your logo when you are in the business of Pest Control you ask?</small></h2>
<br></br>

 <p style="text-align: center">Well, we have a healthy respect for nature, the environment and all the critters in it. All insects and animals have their rightful place, and only become a pest to us when they encroach on our space. Otherwise we believe, they deserve to be left alone.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Bees are industrious, you’ve heard the expression ‘A busy little bee’. Or when your sporting club wants everyone to pitch in and get work done they call it a ‘Busy Bee’.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Bees are essential to us humans. Without bees we would cease to be. They go about their work in a busy, industrious, co-operative way, and contribute to this world of ours being a better place.

<br></br>
<p style="text-align: center">He embodies all of the characteristics we admire, and represents the values we hold dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">We would encourage you to please learn more about beautiful bees.</p>
